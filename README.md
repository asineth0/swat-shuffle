# Swat Shuffle

Shuffle words around the screen.

## Backstory

Built this for my French class. Simply put, we do this thing where there's two teams with fly swatters and they have to hit the right answer on the board to get a point. The teacher was like "oh I wish I could shuffle the words" and I was like: I got you lmao. So, here you go.

## Usage

- Add words seperated by a newline.
- Press "Start" button.
- Press "Space" key to shuffle.

## Libraries

- Built using Vite & TypeScript.
- Icons are from Heroicons.
